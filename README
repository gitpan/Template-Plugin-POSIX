      [% POSIX.log(100) %]
      [% POSIX.rand(1) %]
      [% POSIX.exp(2) %]

      [% POSIX.cos(0) %]

DESCRIPTION
    As a TT programmer, I found it quite inflexible to use the Template
    Toolkit's presentation language Language due to the very limited
    vocabulary. So I wrote this little plugin in order to open a window for
    the template file to the full richness of most POSIX functions, making
    the Template language a "programming language" in a much more serious
    sense.

    Please keep in mind I just used AUTOLOAD, eval, and Data::Dumper to do
    the magic here.

    If you're looking for even more functions, I suggest you take a look at
    the Template::Plugin::Perl module which exports the excellent POSIX
    repertoire.

METHODS
    new Constructor called by the TT2 template system

    throw
        TT2 exception handling procedure.

TODO
    *   Add more unit tests.

SOURCE CONTROL
